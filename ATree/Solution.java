/*
 * N nodes satisfy the following characteristics and make up a binary tree.
 * For each node, 2 child nodes are hung unless its impossible. In this way, proceed until you can no longer hang 2 nodes
 * If there are 2^k - 1 (k is an integer of 0 or higher) nodes, a full binary treek is made (such a binary tree is refereed to as a saturated binary tree)
 * is a case in which there are 15 nodes (N = 15, k = 4). The number on a node represents the node's number
 * There is one node in the highest level. the nodes start from the top, and are added from the left to the right
 * if nodes cant be added at the current level, nodes are added at a one step lower level
 * If the number of nodes N is not 2^k -1, a saturated binary tree cant be made
